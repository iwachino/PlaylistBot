converts apple music playlists to a .txt list of artists and song names

in slightly more words, i'm using a python web scraping library (Beautiful Soup)
too isolate the song names and artists from the playlist
and export them as a comma-separated .txt

my end goal with this is to be able to convert a Apple music playlists to spotify,
and vice versa. if anyone has any ideas on this i'd love to hear them.

feel free to use however.
